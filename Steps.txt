1. Initialize variables and classes (Host class, command line arguments)
2. Main loop (while we still have Frames to send):
  a) Create new "Frame" (Class with variables Length, source host, destination host, transsmission time, type) 
  and add it to source host's Frame queue
  b) Two scenarios:
    1. If channel is idle (Represented by global Frame queue being empty)
      a) Time transmit Frame to destination host is current time + DIFS
    2. If channel is not idle (Represented by global Frame queue not empty)
      a) Create backoff number for source host - if host already has number, decrement
      b) If backoff number count 0, we go to step c, else skip to step e
  c) Add "Frame" to global Wi-Fi channel "Frame queue" (like how we did it for project 1)
  d) Send Frame to source host's Frame queue with time = current + transmission time
  e) Loop through all hosts to check if they need to send an ACK frame for recieved frame
  f) Update statistics
